            <h1>I'm Taylor Claflin.</h1>
            <h2> DSGN 360, Winter Quarter </h2>
            <p>Taylor Claflin is an artist who spends her free time on late-night bedroom floor art projects, starting every day with an unhealthy amount of caffeine, and saving up money to splurge on a new pair of shoes; if you would consider any of those a hobby. She currently resides in Bellingham, WA as a student at Western Washington University, studying design and French. When not in the classroom, you can find her making advertising materials for the Wade King Recreation Center, editorial designs for Klipsun magazine, and one-of-a-kind necklaces, stickers, and prints for her small business, Shop Arts and Trash.</p>
